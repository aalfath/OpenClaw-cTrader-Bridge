# USDJPY Sell — 2026-02-10

## Thesis
**Multi-pair USD weakness confirmation.** Four pairs showing coordinated USD selling:
- USDJPY breaking below 154.75 (H4 support)
- USDCHF breaking below 0.7651 (H4 support)
- USDCAD breaking below 1.3548 (H4 support)
- XAUUSD rallying +50 pips (gold bid = risk-off/USD weakness)

This is institutional positioning against USD ahead of NFP tomorrow. The coordinated breakdown across uncorrelated pairs IS the thesis (per lessons learned 2026-02-09).

H4 trend: Clear lower highs/lower lows from 157.30 → 154.70 over 5 days.

## Entry
- Entry price: ~154.74
- Entry time: 2026-02-10 14:01 UTC
- Trigger: Multi-pair confirmation + H4 breakdown below 154.754

## Risk Management
- Stop-loss: 156.311 (155 pips — broker override, couldn't modify)
- Take-profit: 153.223 (153 pips)
- Risk/Reward: ~1:1
- Position size: 90,000 units (0.9 lots) — reduced from 2.5 lots due to wide SL
- Risk: ~$900 (1% of equity)

**Note:** Broker rejected SL/TP modification requests. Reduced position size to maintain 1% risk with the wider SL.

## Invalidation Conditions
- Break back above 155.50 (would negate breakdown)
- USD strength returns across multiple pairs
- Major USD-positive news before NFP

## Fundamental Anchors
- US retail sales flat in December (USD negative)
- NFP tomorrow Feb 11 — market positioning ahead
- 4-pair USD weakness coordination = institutional flow
