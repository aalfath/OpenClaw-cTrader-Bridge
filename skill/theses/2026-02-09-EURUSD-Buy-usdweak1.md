# EURUSD Buy — 2026-02-09

## Thesis
**Coordinated USD Weakness Theme**

Multiple pairs confirming simultaneous USD selling pressure:
- EURUSD: Breaking H4 high at 1.19044 (currently 1.19066)
- USDJPY: Breakdown below H4 low 155.940 (currently 155.798)
- USDCHF: Breakdown below H4 low 0.76861 (currently 0.76815)
- XAUUSD: Significant 304 pip move higher (currently 5009.87)

This is not an isolated EURUSD move — it's a broad USD rejection across all asset classes. When multiple uncorrelated pairs show the same USD weakness, conviction is higher.

**Fundamental Backdrop:**
- No high-impact events until tomorrow (US Retail Sales Feb 10 at 2:30 PM CET)
- Clear window for momentum continuation
- European session showing strong EUR buying

**Technical Setup:**
- Daily: Strong bullish candle today (+98 pips from open)
