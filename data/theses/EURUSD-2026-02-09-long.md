# EURUSD Long Thesis
**Date:** 2026-02-09 10:02 CET
**Direction:** LONG

## Setup
- **Entry:** 1.1865 (market, on H4 breakout above 1.18644)
- **Stop Loss:** 1.1830 (35 pips, below H4 structure)
- **Take Profit:** 1.1900 (35 pips, 1:1 R:R)
- **Risk:** 1% (~$910)

## Technical Thesis
- EURUSD broke above H4 resistance at 1.18644
- Confirmed breakout (price holding above level)
- USD weakness visible across pairs (USDCHF also breaking down)
- Clean risk definition below recent structure

## Fundamental Context
- **Weak:** ECB's Simkus says 50/50 hike vs cut (neutral)
- **Supportive:** Mild risk-on sentiment, European equities up
- **Missing:** No strong catalyst for USD weakness

## Conviction Level
**Medium** - Technical breakout confirmed but fundamental driver unclear

## Invalidation
- Price closes back below 1.1850 (failed breakout)
- Strong USD catalyst emerges (Fed hawkish surprise)

## Management Plan
- Move SL to breakeven at +20 pips
- Consider partial close at TP1, let runner to 1.1950

## ❌ CLOSED — Thesis Invalidated
**Date:** 2026-02-09 11:03 CET
**Exit Price:** 1.18614
**P&L:** -$186.06 (-6.8 pips)

### Reason for Early Close
Price broke back below the 1.18644 invalidation level — failed breakout pattern. Closed early rather than waiting for full SL hit.

### Lessons Learned
1. **R:R was poor** — actual R:R was 0.82:1 (below the 1.5:1 minimum rule)
2. **No fundamental conviction** — technical-only breakout without macro backing
3. **Early Monday trap** — breakouts at market open often fake out before establishing direction
4. **Better to take small loss** — -$186 loss better than -$998 at SL

### What I'd Do Differently
- Wait for breakout + pullback + retest confirmation
- Require at least one fundamental catalyst before entering
- Avoid trading first 2 hours of Monday session
