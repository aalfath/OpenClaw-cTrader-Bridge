## 2026-02-09: Multi-Pair Confirmation IS a Thesis

**Situation:** USD weakness was visible across 4+ pairs simultaneously:
- EURUSD breaking resistance
- USDCHF breaking support
- USDCAD breaking support
- AUDUSD breaking resistance
- XAUUSD rallying +100 pips

**What I did:** Only entered EURUSD, passed on all others saying:
- "No fundamental catalyst"
- "Would add correlated risk"
- "Testing levels, not breakouts"
- "Chasing" (for gold)

**What happened:** All pairs continued in the same direction. Missed 100+ pips of opportunity across multiple instruments.

**Lesson:** 
- **Coordinated multi-pair moves ARE a fundamental thesis** — they indicate a sentiment shift
- When 4+ uncorrelated pairs confirm the same theme, that IS the catalyst (smart money positioning)
- Don't require a news headline when price is screaming the story
- "Chasing" criticism is invalid for trend continuation — momentum is valid
- Better to take 2-3 smaller positions across pairs than max size on one

**Rule Update:** If 3+ pairs show the same directional bias (USD weakness/strength) within a 2-hour window, treat the coordination as a valid thesis even without explicit news catalyst.

## 2026-02-09: R:R Below Minimum Still Got Stopped

**Situation:** Morning EURUSD trade had 0.82:1 R:R (below 1.5:1 minimum).

**What happened:** Trade invalidated quickly, -$186 loss.

**Lesson:** The R:R minimum exists for a reason. Don't override it even when the setup "looks good."
